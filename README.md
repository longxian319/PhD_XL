# PhD_XL_NeuroTurPatt
This repository aims at developing new turbulence inspired toolboxes for studying the spatio-temporal organization and dynamics of neural oscillation. The majority of the work is done by Xian Long, during his phd study in the complex group, the university of sydney, supervised by Prof. Pulin Gong. The full toolbox will be published separatedly as an independant toolbox for use in any other spatio-temporal studies. Please cite this repository if you use it in your work. 

The current toolbox has been used in 4 projects...
