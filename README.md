# XL_FDP_Gamma
This repository aims at developing new turbulence inspired toolboxes for studying the spatio-temporal organization and dynamics of neural oscillation. The majority of the work is done by Xian Long, during his phd study in the complex group, the university of sydney, supervised by Prof. Pulin Gong. This toolbox includes the detailed analysis of the fractional Lévy motions of propagating neural activity patterns recorded by the local field potential (LFP) data of marmosets. If you use our code in your research, please cite us as follows:
